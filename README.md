# KTU Coding Dojo

Coding Dojo is a place where people practice programming by doing a programming kata.

## Principles

1. All are learners
2. Theory cannot be discussed without code
3. Code cannot exist without tests
4. Writing code is more important than code itself

## Roles

- Pair
  - Navigator - advices what to write, plans a little bit ahead
  - Driver - writes code. Makes the final decision of what gets typed
- Audience - observes, thinks how best solve the problem, stays silent
- Fascilitator - observes, reminds of the Dojo principles, fascilitates (intro, outro)

## Flow

00:00:00 - Introduction to a problem / Dojo
00:15:00 - Coding
01:45:00 - Retro

### Coding

1. Whiteboarding 
   - Cover the first (next) complexity
   - Figure out most simple example
   - Simple initial design
   - Everyone talks
   - Doesn't have to be on every loop
2. A single pair writes code (only they talk)
3. Others observe, stay silent
4. Switch seats by 1 clockwise:
  - Driver goes back to audience
  - Navigator becomes a driver
  - 1 from audience becomes navigator
5. As the switch happens - window for feedback (audience can talk).
6. Repeat

## TDD loop

1. Yellow - Whiteboard (if there is enoug complexity)
2. Red - Write a test
3. Green - Make the test pass (by using whatever shortcuts you can if it's too hard to do a proper solution)
4. Refactor - Refactor
